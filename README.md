2.How to Clone And Setup The Project
 First I instilled git and github and the created an account.
Then I Clicked on the '+' icon in the top-right corner and slected new repository.
I gave my project a name and clicked on create repository to finally create my name repository.
Then I used the link in the I.A to go to Daquiver's repository and copy his URL and clone the 
repository to my computer by using the command git clone + his URL in my terminal to create the copy.
After that I started my project in the clone and initialized and commited it using the command git init
and git commit respestively.
Then I added more to it by using the command git add. After I finished the Project I used get push
to send my clone to my main repository and then I used the pull request in github.
